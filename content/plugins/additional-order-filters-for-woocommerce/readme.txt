== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does search work? =

Just open tabs with additional filters on Woocommerce orders grid page. Enter a value in the field you need and click 'Apply filters' button.

= Can I search for multiple values in one field at once? =

Yes! You can separate values by comma ','. For example, in SKU field: 'MM123, AS321'; Email: 'post@site.com, anna@site.com', etc.

= Can I search for a partial value? =

Yes! For example, order user phone is 1 (111) 682-5352. You can try search any part of this number: '682', '111', '53', '52', etc.

Try to refine your search. Fill in other fields, don't use part of the value.
